## 🏗️ Development aka behind the scenes
This project has been developed using the LAMP/XAMPP/WAMP stack with some JS here and there. Since it deals with dynamically generated html forms, PHP code and the MySQL queries accompanying it, it dwells into a fair bit of complexity. The code is not pretty to look at and refactoring is in the roadmap.

## 🤝 Contributing
Some tasks you can take up
* Refactoring the codebase. Can follow [Clean Code for PHP](https://github.com/piotrplenik/clean-code-php).
* Implementing email alerts and confirmations.
* Event-specific certificate elgibility rules and policies generation.
* Multi-access to the admin dashboard so that volunteers can work together.
* And whatever ideas you have, you can use the issues or discussion page of this repo.
