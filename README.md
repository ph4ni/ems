## üèóÔ∏è Development aka behind the scenes
This project has been developed using the LAMP/XAMPP/WAMP stack with some JS here and there. Since it deals with dynamically generated html forms, PHP code and the MySQL queries accompanying it, it dwells into a fair bit of complexity. The code is not pretty to look at and refactoring is in the roadmap.<br><br>
